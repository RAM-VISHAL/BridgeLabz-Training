# 📅 Day 11 – Static, Final & Type Checking

**Date:** 29-Dec-2025



## 🔹 Activities Performed

- Used `static` keyword for shared values and utility methods to:
  - Reduce memory usage
  - Avoid code redundancy
- Leveraged static context to avoid ambiguity while initializing attributes.
- Declared `final` variables for identifiers and constants that must remain unchanged.
- Used `instanceof` operator for:
  - Safe type checking
  - Preventing runtime errors during type casting.
- Committed and pushed all changes successfully.

# 📅 Day 13 – Inheritance

**Date:** 31-Dec-2025



## 🔹 Activities Performed

- Learned Java Inheritance to reuse properties and behaviors from parent classes.
- Implemented:
  - Single Inheritance
  - Multilevel Inheritance
  - Hierarchical Inheritance
- Practiced method overriding to safely modify parent class behavior.
- Used `super()` to invoke parent class constructors.
- Applied inheritance with polymorphism for dynamic method dispatch.
- Understood access control using `public`, `protected`, `default`, and `private` members.
- Committed and pushed all changes successfully.

# 📅 Day 14 – Encapsulation, Interfaces and Polymorphism

**Date:** 01-Jan-2026

## 🔹 Activities Performed

- Learned Java Inheritance to reuse properties and behaviors from parent classes.
- Implemented **Encapsulation** to protect data and ensure controlled access.
- Practiced **method overriding** to safely modify parent class behavior.
- Used **getter** and **setter** methods for accessing and updating private fields.
- Applied **encapsulation with polymorphism** for dynamic method dispatch.
